# Open Banking Checklist

This is a **checklist** for an **Open Banking** implementation.
This Open Banking checklist gives you a high level view of **Best Practices** for Open Banking.

This checklist is dividing into 3 parts: _must haves_, _should haves_, and _could haves_.

Do everything under the _must haves_.
If you aren't doing _all_ the things under the _must haves_ then you aren't doing Open Banking.

If you want your Open Banking initiative to not be a failure, then do everything under the _should haves_.

If you have the ability to, then it would be a good idea to do as much as you can under the _could haves_.
