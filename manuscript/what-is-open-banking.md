## What Is Open Banking? — For Executives

Open Banking is a way of using technology to give customers, and third-parties _which the customer approves of_:

№1 machine-readable access to that customer's financial data, and

№2 the ability for machines to perform financial transactions on the customer's behalf.

Open Banking sets up the banking industry to **benefit from** the “creative destruction” & innovation of FinTech startups & Tech companies, rather than competing with them in a zero-sum competition.

Open Banking gives customers a way to stay with their existing bank, while at the same time being able to benefit from the the innovations in software, technology, and AI coming from FinTech startups & Tech companies.

Open Banking sets the banking industry up for success as it is faced with technological modernization, by strategically placing the banking industry as the core infrastructure backing FinTech startups & Tech companies.
I.e., with Open Banking, when FinTech startups & Tech companies win the banking industry also wins.

## What Is Open Banking? — For Software Developers

The TL;DR version is: Open Banking is a set of specific APIs.

And hopefully HTTPS-based APIs. But also where cryptographic signatures are used to try to keep things safe & secure.

Most of the API are _request-response_ style that is common with REST based APIs.

For example:
* create account,
* list transactions,
* move money,
* etc.

But also includes some _publish-subscribe_ style APIs.

For example:
* money debited,
* money credited,
* etc.

And all the other usual stuff most Tech companies have when they expose APIs to the public.
