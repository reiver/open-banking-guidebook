# What Is Open Banking?

What is Open Banking‽ — the answer to that question is going to depend on who is asking.

Is an _executive_ asking‽ Is a _software developer_ asking‽ Etc‽

## What Is Open Banking? — For Executives

Open Banking is a way of using technology to give customers, and third-parties _which the customer approves of_:

№1 machine-readable access to that customer's financial data, and

№2 the ability for machines to perform financial transactions on the customer's behalf.

Open Banking sets up the banking industry to **benefit from** the “creative destruction” & innovation of FinTech startups & companies, rather than competing with them in a zero-sum situation.

## What Is Open Banking? — For Software Developers

The TL;DR version is: Open Banking is APIs.

And hopefully HTTPS-based APIs. But also where cryptographic signatures are used to try to keep things safe & secure.

Most of the API are _request-response_ style that is common with REST based APIs.

For example:
* create account,
* list transactions,
* move money,
* etc.

But also includes some _publish-subscribe_ style APIs.

For example:
* money debited,
* money credited,
* etc.

And all the other usual stuff most Tech companies have when they expose APIs to the public.
